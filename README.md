# Income_Prediction_Binary_Classification

The goal of this project is to predict whether a person's income is over 50k or not. It is a binary classification problem.  

The project is outlined in three steps:
  
    1. Data Analysis
    2. Modelling based on the ideas and results of data analysis
    3. Presentation of the results from both data analysis and modelling sections
    
As for data analysis there are a python class and a jupyter notebook. The python class can be imported in the jupyter notebook. This notebook can be run on a local machine provided that all the required libraries are installed. 

The modelling notebook is meant to be run on kaggle. It can also be run on a local machine with a bit change of data-importing, and with enough RAM. 

In the end, there is a presentation file, wherein the whole process with the results have been explained.
